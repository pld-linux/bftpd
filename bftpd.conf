  #If PORT data connections should be opened from port 20, say yes here. You
  #will probably need this if your server is behind a firewall that restricts
  #outgoing packets from ports higher than 1024. Note that this may be a
  #security hole, as the server can not drop its root privileges completely
  #if you say yes here.

  #You can force bftpd to use a specific port range in passive mode.

  #approx. 15 MB/s with XFER_BUFSIZE=2048 and a speed of approx. 20 MB/s
